#Yukon ver.1.10
Bootstrap-based Cotonti Siena admin theme 

##Description
The Yukon theme was designed and built to augment or replace the standard one. The idea behind the project was to allow Cotonti Siena users to access main administration tools via mobile devices (smartphones or tablets), as well as rework usability and add minimalistic design to the back-end.

##Installation
1. Download and copy the theme into the themes/admin/yukon folder
2. Alter the admintheme variable in the config.php: `$cfg['admintheme'] = 'yukon';`

##Demo
Not yet. Screenshots are available @ http://www.cotonti.com/themes/yukon

##Compatibility & Requirements
Can be used with the latest version of the Cotonti Siena CMF, possibly with some not so old previous releases.
Cotonti Genoa? Sorry.
